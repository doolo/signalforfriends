## Contribution
It would be really helpful if the `run.sh` script could be executed regularly to keep the binary apk file up-to-date.

### First Time

    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/signalforfriends.git
    cd signalforfriends
    chmod u+x run.sh

### Later

Later, one can either run the `run.sh` by:

    ./run.sh

Or simply setup a service to run the `run.sh` routinely.
